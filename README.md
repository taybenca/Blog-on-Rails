This project is a tutorial from Ruby on Rails website that helps understand how to use Rails.

I learned how to use the technique CRUD:

C - Create
R - Read
U - Update
D - Delete

and MVC:

M - Model
V - Views
C - Controller


Using this web app you are able to add a new blog, view it, edit it and delete it.
